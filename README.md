# PeopleGrove Code Challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to hack together a web app quickly for us to get a sense of your full-stack development experience. Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions.

The task is to create a simple web app to track the time spent on daily tasks. After logging in, users should be able to log time spent on a particular task. The user should be able to add and edit records of current day and view past records, but should not be able to edit them. Also, provide a admin login which could view all the entries made by each user.

- Please use Node.js backend and Angular or React on the frontend.
- Try to deploy the app on a Heroku free instance - it's so much easier to share and review
- We'd prefer Postgres for the database.
- Users should be able to login/signup via Facebook. This can be the only authentication method.
- Design is a plus! We recommend using a library (like Angular Material or Bootstrap) to make it look clean out of the box.

Some Notes:

1. Using openly available tutorials is great. We're a startup, so no points are awarded for working hard, only getting the job done quickly and correctly.
2. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Points are not deducted for questions. Part of the exercise is to see how we communicate and if
we can be efficient.
3. Make sure you test your work, and if you have them, provide the tests to us. It's important to know there is attention to detail in your work.
4. Be creative! Points for thinking holistically about the app and tailoring it to a use case.
